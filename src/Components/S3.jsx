              <h1 style={{textAlign:'justify', padding:'20px 200px'}}>Why Should I Consider Using Amazon S3?</h1>
              <p style={{textAlign:'justify', padding:'20px 200px',fontSize:'20px'}}>If youâ€™re still not sure whether Amazon S3 is right for your organization, consider this: Amazon S3 is designed for 99.999999999% (11 9s) of data durability. With that level of durability, you can expect that if you store 10,000,000 objects in Amazon S3, you should only expect to lose a single object every 10,000 years!
